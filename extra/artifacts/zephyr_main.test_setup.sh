# This script is sourced from extra/ci_test_list.sh to provide
# artifact-specific tests for Zephyr CI tests.

# Two helper functions are provided for easy GitHub queries:
# - get_branch_tip <repo> <branch> [<path> ...]
# - get_latest_release <repo> [<path> ...]
#
# By default, the whole project will be added to the test suite.
# When given additional path arguments, the functions will only
# copy artifacts under the provided paths.
